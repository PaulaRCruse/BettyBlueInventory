Betty Blue Pottery & Rock Inventory System

This project is to create a simple invetory & purchase system for a Pottery shop. To track and update inventory as items are purchaed. 

Requirement for the README file that explains:
1. Description of what my project is
2. Which 3 features I have included from the Features List provided by Code Louisville
3. Any special instructions for the reviewer to run my project

Features List

1. Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program

2. Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program

3. Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code. To clarify, at least one function should be called in your code, that function should calculate, retrieve, or otherwise set the value of a variable or data structure, return a value to where it was called, and use that value somewhere else in your code. For example, you could create a function that reads how many items there are in a text file, returns that value, and later uses that value to execute a loop a certain number of times.
